To speedup development this web app uses node.js and bower to concatenate
and minify Javascript and CSS on the fly.

1. Be sure to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Install dev dependencies with `npm install`
3. Install Bower `npm install -g bower`
3. Install runtime dependencies with `bower install`

How to Run
-----------
Just run `gulp dev` to start watching file changes and kickoff the dev process.
